# GliDe with a CaPE ICML 2024
Official code for [GLIDE with a CAPE: A Low-Hassle Method to Accelerate Speculative Decoding](https://openreview.net/pdf/42c2aa07edff016e6b145a91c941fb44754cd84d.pdf).

Currently, the codebase is a little bit ugly, and I will try to re-built it.


# TODO
- [x] Triton-based Tree Attention
- [ ] Copy-based Tree KV Cache
- [ ] Training with clean codebase, remove ugly deepspeed.
